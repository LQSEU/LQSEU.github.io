**Cooperative Relative Pose Estimation towards Real World Multi Robot Systems (Crepes)**

***Huzhou Research Institute, Zhejiang University (2022-2023)***                           

- Project repository: [https://fast-fire.github.io/CREPES/](https://fast-fire.github.io/CREPES/)
- Iteratively optimized Crepes hardware to reduce the volume and improve the accuracy of Crepes from the first version to the third version;
-  Explored the infrared communication scheme, used the UWB clock as the system clock to improve the identification frequency of optical communication, and realized that the error of optical communication time synchronization was 2.4ms after 10000fps testing by a high-speed camera.
- Optimized and reconstructed the Crepes Ros code.
- Achieved the dual-machine full attitude detection error through optimization, in the end, pose error: under 0.1m orientation error: 1.3~1.7°.

**Rigid and Flexible Coupled Structures Using A Thin-wall Spring Steel Sheet**

***School of Instrument Science and Engineering, Southeast University (2020-2022)***                                                         
- Explored the modeling simulation optimization method of extended-bending structure, and realized the co-simulation of abaqus and python, and the simulation optimization of Recurdyn rigid-flexible multi-body dynamic
- Set up a system to test hardware, software, and sensor systems, including hardware circuit rendering, sensor data acquisition and filtering processing of upper computer, etc.
- Compiled relevant application papers, focusing on hand rehabilitation exoskeleton, bionic robot, and space continuum robot arm.

**Research and Verification of Learning Method with Autonomous Smart and Precise Operation**

***School of Instrument Science and Engineering, Southeast University  (2020-2021)***                                                        
- Participated in the research of building a multi-mode data acquisition system of space operation terminal, and collected information about hand movement, electromyography, and eye movement.
