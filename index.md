**Cooperative Relative Pose Estimation towards Real World Multi Robot Systems (Crepes)**
**Huzhou Research Institute, Zhejiang University                                         2022-Present**                                                                         
- Iteratively optimized Crepes hardware to reduce the volume and quality of Crepes and optimize the heat dissipation; made the final volume of the device reach 83*57*75mm (including antenna) with the weight of 143g for the positioning of UAV
-  Explored the infrared communication scheme, used the UWB clock as the system clock to improve the identification frequency of optical communication, and realized that the error of optical communication time synchronization was 2.4ms after 10000fps testing by high-speed camera
- Optimized and reconstructed the Crepes Ros code, and maintained the github warehouse of the laboratory Crepes
- Achieved the dual-machine full attitude detection error through optimization in the end, pose error: 13~15cm orientation error: 1.3~1.7°
